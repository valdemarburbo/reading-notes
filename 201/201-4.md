## Questions

**1. When should you use an `unordered` list in your HTML document?**  

The `<ul>` element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. 

**2. How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?**

The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

**3. When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unorder list` in your HTML document?**

The `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the `<ol>` element, the order is meaningful. To determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the `<ol>` element should be used, otherwise you can use `<ul>`.

**4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?**  

*reversed*

This Boolean attribute specifies that the list's items are in reverse order. Items will be numbered from high to low.

*start*

An integer to start counting from for the list items. Always an Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, etc.), even when the numbering type is letters or Roman numerals. For example, to start numbering elements from the letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv," use start="4".

*type*

Sets the numbering type:

- a for lowercase letters
- A for uppercase letters
- i for lowercase Roman numerals
- I for uppercase Roman numerals
- 1 for numbers (default)

The specified type is used for the entire list unless a different type attribute is used on an enclosed `<li>` element.

**5. Describe the CSS properties of `margin` and `padding` as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

**6. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the `box model`.**

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

**7. What `data types` can you store inside of an `Array`?**

Numbers, strings, other arrays, objects.

**8. Is the `people` array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

    const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

It is a valid JavaScript array, because it is possible to include arraays within an array. If I wanted to access the first array, I would write the following code:

    people[0]

If I wanted to access the first item from the first array in an array, I would write the following code:

    people[0][0]

**9. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

- Addition assignment `x += f()` means `x = x + f()`

- Subtraction assignment `x -= f()` means	`x = x - f()`

- Multiplication assignment `x *= f()` means `x = x * f()`

- Division assignment `x /= f()` means `x = x / f()`
 
- Remainder assignment `x %= f()` means `x = x % f()`

**10. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

    let a = 10;
    let b = 'dog';
    let c = false;

    // evaluate this
    (a + c) + b;

The expression will result in "10dog". This is due to `false` being equal to 0.

**11. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

One could have an app, that would display a welcome message "Good morning, user" or "Good evening, user" depending on the time of day.

**12. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**

One might want to print all of the items in a shopping cart (which could be in array). To accomplish this, a loop would be useful.
