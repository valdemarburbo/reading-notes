## Questions

**1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**  

Semantics are relied on everywhere around us—we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be. So, for example, we expect a red traffic light to mean "stop," and a green traffic light to mean "go." Things can get tricky very quickly if the wrong semantics are applied. (Do any countries use red to mean "go"? We hope not.)

In a similar way, we need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance. In this context, the h1 element is also a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

    <h1>This is a top level heading</h1>

By default, the browser will give it a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted using CSS). More importantly, its semantic value will be used in multiple ways, for example by search engines and screen readers (as mentioned above).

On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading. Consider the following:


    <span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0; display: block;">
      Is this a top level heading?
    </span>

This is a `<span>` element. It has no semantics. You use it to wrap content when you want to apply CSS to it (or do something to it with JavaScript) without giving it any extra meaning. (You'll find out more about these later on in the course.) We've applied some CSS to it to make it look like a top level heading, but since it has no semantic value, it will not get any of the extra benefits described above. It is a good idea to use the relevant HTML element for the job.

**2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**

There are six heading elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; `<h1>` represents the main heading, `<h2>` represents subheadings, `<h3>` represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

**3. What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?**

You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements handle this job. For example:

    <p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
    <p>
    Caffeine's chemical formula is
    C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>

**4. When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**  

Another fairly common element you'll meet when looking around the Web is `<abbr>` — this is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the `<abbr>` to mark up the abbreviation. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means.

If providing the expansion in addition to the abbreviation makes little sense, and the abbreviation or acronym is a fairly shortened term, provide the full expansion of the term as the value of title attribute:

    <p>
    We use <abbr>HTML</abbr>, Hypertext Markup Language, to structure our web
    documents.
    </p>

    <p>
    I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with
    the chainsaw.
    </p>

**5. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

External stylesheet, internal stylesheet (within `<style>` element, contained in `<head>` element) and inline style (using a `style` attribute in HTML elements).

**6. Why should we avoid using inline styles?**

It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.

**7. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:**

    h2 {
        color: black;
        padding: 5px;
    }

**7.1 What is representing the selector?**

`h2` is representing the selector.

**7.2 Which components are the CSS declarations?**

`color: black;` and `padding: 5px;` are CSS declarations. 

The CSS declaration block is represented below:

    {
        color: black;
        padding: 5px;
    }
**7.3 Which components are considered properties?**

`color` and `padding` are CSS properties.

**8. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?**

This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks. For an example:

    let myVariable = 'Bob'; 
or

    let myVariable = "Bob";

**9. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.**

#### Addition ####

Add two numbers together or combine two strings. 

    6 + 9;
    'Hello ' + 'world!';

#### Subtraction, Multiplication, Division ####

These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.

    9 - 3;
    8 * 2; // multiply in JS is an asterisk
    9 / 3;

#### Assignment ####

As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable.

    let myVariable = 'Bob';

#### Strict equality ####

This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.

    let myVariable = 3;
    myVariable === 4;

#### Not, Does-not-equal ####

This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.

For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate it:

    let myVariable = 3;
    !(myVariable === 3);

"Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable NOT equal to 3". This returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3:

    let myVariable = 3;
    myVariable !== 3;

**13. Describe a real world problem you could solve with a Function.**

One can design a dog age converter, that would show dog age in human years.
