# 102-1 Learning Markdown

## Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments, everyone can change and grow through application and experience.

To stay in the growth mindset, I must remember to:  

1. **Embrace the challenges.** If it gets too frustrating, I need to acknowledge that and take a step back. Taking a break and looking at the problem with a fresh mind will often help to identify new potential ways of reaching a solution.  
2. **Reflect often.** It is beneficial to incorporate frequent reviews of one's days (or weeks/months etc.) to identify good and bad aspects. This will help me to calibrate my strategies for increased productivity. It will also allow me to acknowledge progress and reduce the impact of the imposter syndrome.
3. **Celebrate the success of others.** Be inspired by the victories of your colleagues and use them as an example for your improvement. Openness and kindness will forge strong bonds inside teams and enable an environment encouraging learning and maximising productivity.

## Questions

**1. What is Markdown?**  

Markdown is an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without the use of a formal text editor or the use of HTML tags. Markdown is device agnostic and displays the writing format consistently across device types.  
     
**2. Why do we use Markdown?**  

* Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites,        documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
* Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
* Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
* Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
* Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.  

**3. What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?**  

The "#" symbol before the text.
    **1. How many do you need to create the largest heading?**  

    One "#" symbol for the largest heading.  

    **2. How many do you need to create the smallest heading?**  

        Six "#" symbols for the smallest heading.  

**4. When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?**  

    It is best to wrap the target text with "*" symbol for italicised and "**" symbols for bold text. 

**5. How do you create a link with Markdown?**  

    To create a link the following syntax must be used: "(clickable text)[link address]"  

**6. What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?**  

    Dash (-), asterisk (*) or plus (+).
