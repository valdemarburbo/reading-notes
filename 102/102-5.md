## Questions

**1. What is the purpose of CSS?**

CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

**2. What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* **External CSS**

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the ***link*** element, inside the head section.

Example:

    External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html> 
* **Internal CSS**

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the ***style*** element, inside the head section.

Example:

     <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <style>
    body {
        background-color: linen;
        }

    h1 {
        color: maroon;
        margin-left: 40px;
        }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html> 

* **Inline CSS**

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Example:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

**3. Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all ***p*** elements red text.**

    p {
        color: red;
    }
