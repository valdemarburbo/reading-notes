## Questions

**1. What are variables in JavaScript?**  

Variables are containers for storing data.  

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:  

* Automatically;
* Using var;
* Using let;
* Using const;


***When to Use var, let, or const?***

1. Always declare variables.

2. Always use *const* if the value should not be changed.

3. Always use *const* if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects).

4. Only use *let* if you can't use *const*.

5. Only use *var* if you MUST support old browsers.  

**2. What does it mean to *declare* a variable?**

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.  

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:  

    var carName;  

or:  

    let carName;

After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).  

To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:  

    carName = "Volvo";

You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:  

    let carName = "Volvo";

**3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?**

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.  

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:  

    x = x + 5  

In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.  

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)  

***Note***

The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

**4. What is information received from the user called?**  

Any information or data sent to a computer for processing is considered input. Input or user input is sent to a computer using an input device.
