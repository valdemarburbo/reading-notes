# Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments, everyone can change and grow through application and experience.

To stay in the growth mindset, I must remember to:  

1. **Embrace the challenges.** If it gets too frustrating, I need to acknowledge that and take a step back. Taking a break and looking at the problem with a fresh mind will often help to identify new potential ways of reaching a solution.  
2. **Reflect often.** It is beneficial to incorporate frequent reviews of one's days (or weeks/months etc.) to identify good and bad aspects. This will help me to calibrate my strategies for increased productivity. It will also allow me to acknowledge progress and reduce the impact of the imposter syndrome.
3. **Celebrate the success of others.** Be inspired by the victories of your colleagues and use them as an example for your improvement. Openness and kindness will forge strong bonds inside teams and enable an environment encouraging learning and maximising productivity.
